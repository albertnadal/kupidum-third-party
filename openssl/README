This is a tutorial for using self-compiled builds of  the OpenSSL-library on the iPhone. You can build apps with XCode and the official SDK from Apple with this. I also made a small example-app for using the libraries with XCode and the iPhone/iPhone-Simulator. You can also download the precompiled OpenSSL-library (1.0.0d).

Enjoy OpenSSL on the iPhone!

I have made an iOS 4.0 XCode Project with OpenSSL 1.0.0d Libaries. The examples uses the MD5 or SHA256-algorithm to calculate an md5 or sha256 hash from an UITextfield.
